## August workshop reflections

### Focus

The August workshop focused on effective mobbing when there are many unknowns.

### Workshop summary

The mob had a very ambiguous choice about what to work on (they could choose whatever they wanted from the backlog), and no tools, test frameworks, or programming language were specified.

We practiced:

- forming working agreements early
- making decisions as a mob when requirements aren't clear
- setting up tools from scratch as a mob
- early experiments
- mid-mob research
- inspecting and adjusting

We observed:

- consensus doesn't always provide the best solution; The antidote: early experiments
- mob decisions are hard, but made easier by mobbing on a document that describes them
- newbie navigators struggle. let's help them when we inspect.
